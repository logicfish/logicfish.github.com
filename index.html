		<h3>Cloudlets</h3>
		<p>
		<a href="/cloudlets">Cloudlets</a> is a new semantic platform for distributed services.
		<p></p>
		<h3>Cloudlet Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Distributed subject-oriented middleware protocol.</li>
			<li>Alternative tuple-based URL syntax for browsing/accessing subjects in the cloud.</li>
		</ul>
		Browsing and searching are combined.  Cloudlet sessions are application contexts represented by unique subjects
		in the cloud.  
		<p></p>
		<h3>Cloudlets Distributed protocol.</h3>
		Scientists can store informational content, meta-data or processes attached to tuple vectors, which may
		be patterns, and describe the location of the content in the cloud stores.  Client applications then access
		the content by issuing queries that align to nodes in the store.  To accept the results of a query, the client
		creates a service vector, and attaches the identifier of this service to the query vector.  Applications in the cloud which
		can recognise the query then publish services to the client's service enabling them to retrieve the relevant information.
		Nodes may also contain lambda functions which are applied during the matching selection process to determine
		if a particular subject contributes to a particular vector.  These functions should always be idempotent; however,
		the content of a node may contain processes in the form of service descriptors which allow 'actions' or operations to be performed
		by a user.
